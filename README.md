# twirp-grpc-transcode

[![PkgGoDev](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/bakins/twirp-grpc-transcode)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/bakins/twirp-grpc-transcode)

`twirp-grpc-transcode` transcodes [twirp](https://github.com/twitchtv/twirp) to [grpc](https://grpc.io/).

```
client->twirp->grpc
```

### Why would one use this?

You probably shouldn't. However, if someone was looking to support both twirp and grpc,
or migrate from one to the other, this may be helpful.

## Status
